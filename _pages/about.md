I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof. [Geir Dullerud](https://mechse.illinois.edu/people/profile/dullerud). My research focuses on learning-based control and motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Specifically, my work develops methodologies that combine nominal model gradients with real system data to learn control policies applied to autonomous vehicles. I have hands-on experience with [F1-Tenth](https://f1tenth.org/) and [Crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/old-products/crazyflie-2-0/) platforms. In addition to my Ph.D. studies, I joined the Control team at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/) as an intern, where I focused on developing the dynamical vehicle model.

Before starting my Ph.D. at UIUC, I received a Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering at National Taiwan University. I worked in the [Bio-inspired Robotics Laboratory](http://biorola.me.ntu.edu.tw/) with Prof. Pei-Chun Lin, focusing on modeling, control, and locomotion of legged robots. I built a quadruped robot and developed a reduced-order model to investigate its leaping, flipping, and running motions.
